# AFL Prediction System - Changes and Enhancements

This document outlines the changes and enhancements made to the AFL prediction system as requested.

## 1. Data Structure for Manual Updates

A new data structure has been set up to support manual updates of data as rounds progress:

```
data/
├── raw/
│   ├── historical/    # Historical player statistics from previous seasons
│   ├── current/       # Current season player statistics (updated weekly)
│   ├── fixtures/      # Upcoming match fixtures and schedules
│   └── templates/     # Template CSV files showing expected data formats
└── processed/         # Processed data for ML models
```

Each directory contains a README.md file with detailed instructions on:
- Expected file formats
- Naming conventions
- Required data columns
- Update process

## 2. Multi-Task Learning Model

A new multi-task learning model has been implemented that can simultaneously predict multiple related targets:

- **Targets**: Disposals and goals (as requested, fantasy points were removed)
- **Architecture**: Neural network with shared layers and task-specific output heads
- **Benefits**: 
  - Improved prediction accuracy through shared learning
  - More efficient training process
  - Better generalization across related tasks

The implementation is in `scripts/multi_task_learning.py` and includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model building and training
- Evaluation metrics
- Prediction pipeline

## 3. Reinforcement Learning System

A reinforcement learning system has been implemented that learns optimal prediction strategies over time based on prediction success:

- **Components**:
  - `PredictionEnvironment`: Tracks prediction performance and provides rewards
  - `RLAgent`: Learns to adjust predictions based on past performance
  
- **Features**:
  - Tracks historical prediction accuracy
  - Adjusts predictions based on learned patterns
  - Visualizes performance metrics
  - Continuously improves over time

The implementation is in `scripts/reinforcement_learning.py` and includes:
- State representation of prediction environment
- Action selection for prediction adjustments
- Reward calculation based on prediction accuracy
- Q-learning for strategy optimization

## 4. Enhanced Web Interface

The web interface has been significantly enhanced with interactive elements and visual improvements:

- **Visual Enhancements**:
  - SVG team logos for all 18 AFL teams
  - Improved card styling with shadows and hover effects
  - Animations for page elements (fade-in, slide-in)
  - Responsive design for all screen sizes

- **Interactive Elements**:
  - Team logo hover effects
  - Interactive prediction badges
  - Tooltips for additional information
  - Dynamic content loading

- **New Features**:
  - Visualization of multi-task learning and reinforcement learning capabilities
  - Performance metrics charts
  - Enhanced fixture display with team logos

The enhancements are implemented in:
- `web_app/static/css/style.css`: Enhanced styling
- `web_app/static/js/main.js`: Interactive functionality
- `web_app/templates/index.html`: Updated homepage layout
- `web_app/static/images/teams/`: SVG team logos

## 5. Integration

All components have been integrated to work together:
- The data structure supports the multi-task learning model
- The multi-task learning model feeds into the reinforcement learning system
- The web interface displays the results from both learning systems
- The entire system updates as new data is manually added to the raw data directories
